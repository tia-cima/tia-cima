# Hi ðŸ‘‹

IT specialist with an eye for open source. All my projects will forever be free. 

Specialized in creating and implementing open source, self hosted and privacy oriented applications for my company. 

Learning about cybersecurity at UniversitÃ  di Milano. 

I code mainly with Python and its thousand frameworks, like Django, but the syntax isn't as important as the logic and the problem solving skills that can help you use whatever language you want.
